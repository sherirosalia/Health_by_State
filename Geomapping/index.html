          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h2>

          <blockquote><p>"You can never be too rich or too thin." - Wallis Simpson</p></blockquote>

           <p>Whether the statement cited above by the Duchess of Windsor was correct or not is up for debate. However, it provides
             a springboard to explore health and wealth correlations using data analysis of publicly available government census data. 
          </p> 
             
          <p>Are the rich thinner? Conversely, are the poor heavier?  Let's see what the data says. By selecting "obese" and "income" in the chart above,
            the "States" (represented by circles) will arrange themselves with the heaviest populations rising to the top. Indeed, the chart does seem to suggest a correlation 
            between poverty and extra weight as it seems some of our poorest states are among the heaviest. That being said,
            whether or not this is a coincidence or involves causation would require more research. For example culture, 
            genetics, weather and injuries can influence weight gain, and those factors are not explored here. </p>
             
          <p>The chart above uses <a href = 'https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml' target="_blank"> US census data from 2014, </a> 
            Explore the data to evaluate potential connections betweem health risks, income and age by utilizing the options along the x and y axes to see how states, obesity rates, smoking and access to healthcare compare to one another. </p>

          <p>For this project javascript and d3.js were used to propogate the table and scatter plot.</p>
